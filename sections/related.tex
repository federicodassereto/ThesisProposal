\section{State of the Art}\label{related}
In this section, we present related work that we consider relevant for the proposed research project. In order to facilitate reading, the discussion has been organized into fuor main sections, corresponding to the main concepts introduced in Section \ref{motivations} and \ref{reference}. Each of the four sections is in turn divided into sub-parts to further facilitate reading. The first one discusses embeddings approaches and their relevance to the proposal, the second introduces Open Data and their common operations, the third provides an overview of existing augmentation approaches and finally the fourth reviews functional dependencies discovery approaches.
